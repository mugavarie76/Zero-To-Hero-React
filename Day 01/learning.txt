Async Vs Defer

Normal Scenario

HTML parsing will get stop when the script loads from the network and completes the execution of the script. Once this is done the HTML parsing will resume and complete.

async

In async, along with HTML parsing the loading of script will happen asynchronously once the loading of the script completed the HTML parsing stops the parsing and waits till the script execution is completed. Once this is done the HTML parsing will resume and complete.

Specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available (before parsing completes) (only for external scripts)

defer

In defer, along with HTML parsing the loading of script will happen asynchronously and completes the loading. Once the HTML parsing is completed then the script will start execute.

Specifies that the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing (only for external scripts)
